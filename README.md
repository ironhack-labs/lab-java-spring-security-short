## Instructions

For this activity, you will be building a content management system for a blog with multiple authors.

1. **Create tables:** Create the tables for the blog post and author in your database.
2. **Use Spring Security:** Use Spring Security to create an admin role.
3. **Create routes:** Create the following routes:

   - Get the post and the author
   - Add post
   - Add author
   - Update post
   - Update author
   - Delete post
   - Delete author

4. **Restrict access:** Use Spring Security to ensure only admins can access every route except the GET route, which should be publicly available.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">I am stuck and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start. What should I do?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear, straight forward question about the specific issue you are facing. The process you will go through while trying to define this question, will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.

For example, are you facing a problem because you don't understand the concept or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources.

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you should be able to start working toward the solution.

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

Spring boot is a framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade applications that are easy to launch and run. The best way to create a Spring boot project is to use the Spring Initializer website. The website provides a convenient way to generate a basic project structure with all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

- Step 1: Go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/)
- Step 2: Choose the type of project you want to create, such as Maven or Gradle.
- Step 3: Select the version of Spring Boot you want to use.
- Step 4: Choose the dependencies you need for your project. Some common dependencies include web, jpa and data-jpa.
- Step 5: Click the "Generate" button to download the project files.

Alternatively, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. These IDEs have plugins for creating Spring boot projects, making it easy to set up the environment and get started with coding.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is JPA and how can I use it in Java?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

JPA stands for Java Persistence API, which is a Java specification for accessing, persisting and managing data between Java objects and a relational database. JPA provides a standard interface for accessing databases, reducing the need for custom data access code and enabling efficient management of database connections.

To use JPA in Java, you will need to include the necessary dependencies in your project, such as the Hibernate JPA implementation and create entity classes to represent your data. These entity classes will be annotated with JPA-specific annotations, such as `@Entity` and `@Id`, to indicate the mapping between the Java class and the database table.

Here is a code snippet to show you how to create a JPA entity class in Java:

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private int id;

  private String name;
  private int age;
  private String position;

  // Getters and Setters for the attributes
}
```

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of using the "@Entity", "@Table" and "@Column" annotations in JPA (Java Persistence API)?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

The `@Entity`, `@Table` and `@Column` annotations in JPA (Java Persistence API) are used to map Java objects to relational database tables.

`@Entity` is used to mark a class as a persistent entity. This means that instances of the class can be stored in a database.

`@Table` is used to define the name of the database table that the entity will be mapped to.

`@Column` is used to define the columns in the table that correspond to the attributes of the entity.

Here is an example of how to use these annotations:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name="employee")
public class Employee {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
  @Column(name="id")
  private int id;

  @Column(name="first_name")
  private String firstName;

  @Column(name="last_name")
  private String lastName;

  //getters and setters
}
```

In this example, the `Employee` class is marked as a persistent entity using the `@Entity` annotation. The name of the database table is defined using the `@Table` annotation as "employee". The `id`, `firstName` and `lastName` attributes are mapped to columns in the "employee" table using the `@Column` annotation.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of using the "@RestController", "@GetMapping" and "@ResponseStatus" annotations in Java for building a RESTful web service?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

The `@RestController` annotation is used in Java to define a class as a RESTful web service controller. This annotation allows the class to handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.

The `@GetMapping` annotation is used to map a specific HTTP GET request to a method in a controller class. This allows the method to handle the request and return a response.

The `@ResponseStatus` annotation is used to set the HTTP status code for the response returned by a method in a controller class.

Here's a code snippet showing how to use these annotations in Java:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

@RestController
public class ExampleController {

  @GetMapping("/example")
  @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)
  public String exampleMethod() {
    return "This is a response from a RESTful web service";
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ExampleController` class is defined as a RESTful web service controller using the `@RestController` annotation. The `exampleMethod` is mapped to a specific HTTP GET request using the `@GetMapping("/example")` annotation and the HTTP status code for the response is set to `HTTP 200 OK` using the `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)` annotation.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What are the "@RestController", "@PostMapping", "@PutMapping", "@PatchMapping" and "@ResponseStatus" annotations in Java and how are they used for building a RESTful web service?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

The `@RestController`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@PatchMapping` and `@ResponseStatus` annotations are used in Java for building RESTful web services.

The `@RestController` annotation is used to denote that a class serves as a REST controller. This means that the class will handle HTTP requests and provide responses in a RESTful manner.

The `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping` and `@PatchMapping` annotations are used to handle HTTP POST, PUT and PATCH requests respectively. These annotations are used to specify the endpoint that will handle the respective request type.

The `@ResponseStatus` annotation is used to set the HTTP response status code.

Here is an example of how these annotations can be used:

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

  @PostMapping("/api/create")
  @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
  public MyEntity create(@RequestBody MyEntity entity) {
    // logic to create the entity
    return entity;
  }

  @PutMapping("/api/update/{id}")
  @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)
  public MyEntity update(@PathVariable long id, @RequestBody MyEntity entity) {
    // logic to update the entity
    return entity;
  }

  @PatchMapping("/api/partial-update/{id}")
  @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)
  public MyEntity partialUpdate(@PathVariable long id, @RequestBody MyEntity entity) {
    // logic to partially update the entity
    return entity;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@RestController` annotation is applied to the class `MyController`, indicating that it serves as a REST controller. The `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping` and `@PatchMapping` annotations are used to handle HTTP POST, PUT and PATCH requests respectively. The `@ResponseStatus` annotation is used to set the HTTP response status code to `HttpStatus.CREATED`, `HttpStatus.OK`, or `HttpStatus.OK` respectively.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of using "@NotEmpty", "@Pattern" and "@Digits" annotations in Java?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

The `@NotEmpty`, `@Pattern` and `@Digits` annotations in Java are used to validate the input values of a form or a request body. These annotations are used to make sure that the input values are not empty, match a specific pattern, or have a specific number of digits.

Here's a code snippet that demonstrates the use of these annotations:

```java
public class User {

  @NotEmpty(message = "Name cannot be empty")
  private String name;

  @Pattern(regexp = "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$", message = "Invalid email format")
  private String email;

  @Digits(integer = 5, fraction = 0, message = "Contact number must have 5 digits")
  private String contactNumber;

  // getters and setters
}
```

In the above code, the `name` field must not be empty, the `email` field must match the specified email pattern and the `contactNumber` field must have 5 digits. If any of these conditions are not met, a message will be displayed to the user.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of "@JsonIgnore" in Java and how is it used?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

The `@JsonIgnore` annotation is used in Jackson (a popular library for JSON processing) to ignore a property when serializing or deserializing an object to/from JSON. This means that when the object is converted to JSON, the property marked with `@JsonIgnore` will not be included in the JSON representation.

The `@JsonIgnore` annotation is applied to a property in a Java class to ignore it during JSON serialization or deserialization. For example, consider a class named Employee with a property named "password". To ignore the "password" property, we can annotate it with `@JsonIgnore`:

```java
public class Employee {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  @JsonIgnore
  private String password;

  // getters and setters for the properties
}
```

When this class is serialized to JSON, the "password" property will not be included in the JSON representation.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is "JpaRepository" and how can I use it in Java?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

`JpaRepository` is a Spring Data interface that extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository` interface. It provides all the basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations and additional methods to work with **JPA (Java Persistence API)** to interact with the database.

To use `JpaRepository` in your project, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
```

Step 2: Create an interface that extends `JpaRepository`

```java
public interface MyRepository extends JpaRepository<MyEntity, Long> {

}
```

**Note**: In the above code, `MyEntity` is the entity class that you want to interact with the database and Long is the type of the primary key of `MyEntity`.

Step 3: Inject the interface in the class where you want to use it.

```java
@Autowired
private MyRepository myRepository;
```

Step 4: You can now use the methods provided by `JpaRepository` to interact with the database, for example:

```java
MyEntity myEntity = new MyEntity();
myRepository.save(myEntity);
```

With the above steps, you can now use `JpaRepository` to interact with the database in your Java project.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What are derived query methods in JPA and how do I use them in Java?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

Derived query methods in JPA are methods in a JPA repository that are automatically generated by the framework based on method names. These methods allow developers to perform common database operations such as finding entities based on specific criteria, sorting, pagination and more, without having to manually write the corresponding SQL query.

To use derived query methods in Java with JPA, follow these steps:

1. Create a JPA repository interface: To start, create an interface that extends `JpaRepository` and specifies the entity class and the primary key data type. For example:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
   import org.example.domain.User;

   public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
   }
   ```

2. Define the method name: Next, you can define the method name based on the query you want to perform. There are several conventions that JPA follows to determine the query to be executed, such as keywords such as `findBy`, `readBy`, `queryBy`, `countBy` and `deleteBy`, followed by the name of the entity’s properties. For example, to find all users with a specific first name, you can define the method name as follows:

   ```java
   List<User> findByFirstName(String firstName);
   ```

3. Inject the repository: Finally, you can inject the repository into your service or component class and call the methods to perform the query operations.

   ```java
   @Autowired
   private UserRepository userRepository;

   public List<User> getUsersByFirstName(String firstName) {
     return userRepository.findByFirstName(firstName);
   }
   ```

**Note**: The exact implementation of derived query methods may vary depending on the JPA implementation you are using (e.g., Hibernate, EclipseLink, etc.). However, the basic concept of using method names to generate queries remains the same.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">How can I use the JPA annotations "@OneToOne", "@OneToMany", "@ManyToOne", "@ManyToMany", "@JoinColumn" and "@JoinTable" in Java?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

The Java Persistence API (JPA) provides several annotations for mapping relationships between entities in Java applications. These annotations include:

1. **@OneToOne**: This annotation is used to define a one-to-one relationship between two entities. The following code shows how to use the `@OneToOne` annotation:

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  private String name;

  @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  @JoinColumn(name = "address_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
  private Address address;

  // Getters and setters ...
}

@Entity
public class Address {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  private String street;

  private String city;

  // Getters and setters ...
}
```

2. **@OneToMany & @ManyToOne**: These annotations are used to define one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between two entities.

The following code shows how to use the `@OneToMany` and the `@ManyToOne` annotation:

```java
@Entity
public class Department {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  private String name;

  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
  private List<Employee> employees;

  // Getters and setters ...
}

@Entity
public class Employee {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  private String name;

  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = "department_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
  private Department department;

  // Getters and setters ...
}
```

3. **@ManyToMany & @JoinColumn & @JoinTable**: The `@ManyToMany` annotation is used in Java to define a many-to-many relationship between two entities. This means that multiple instances of one entity can be related to multiple instances of another entity.

The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used in Java to specify the foreign key column that will be used to join the two entities. The foreign key column is used to establish a relationship between the entities.

The `@JoinTable` annotation is used in Java to define a join table for a many-to-many relationship. The join table is used to store the relationship information between the two entities.

The following code shows how to use the `@ManyToMany`, `@JoinColumn` and `@JoinTable` annotations:

```java
@Entity
public class User {

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name = "user_role",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "user_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "role_id"))
    private List<Role> roles;

}

@Entity
public class Role {

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "roles")
    private List<User> users;

}
```

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of using "@RequiredArgsConstructor", "@AllArgsConstructor", "@NoArgsConstructor", "@Data" annotations in Java?</summary>

<br> <!-- ✅ -->

These are annotations in Java used to generate constructors for classes.

- `@RequiredArgsConstructor`: generates a constructor with parameters for final fields or fields annotated with `@NonNull`.
- `@AllArgsConstructor`: generates a constructor with parameters for all fields in the class.
- `@NoArgsConstructor`: generates a default constructor with no parameters.
- `@Data`: combines the functionalities of `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations into a single annotation.

These annotations are used to reduce the boilerplate code and make the code more concise and readable. They also help to prevent errors in coding by generating the necessary constructors and methods automatically.

To use these annotations in your Java code, you first need to import them from the `lombok` library. You can then use the annotations on your class definition as follows:

```java
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@RequiredArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
public class MyClass {
  private final String field1;
  private String field2;
}
```

In this example, the annotations are used to generate a constructor with parameters for final fields, a constructor with parameters for all fields and a default constructor with no parameters. The `@Data` annotation also generates the `toString`, equals and `hashCode` methods for the class.
